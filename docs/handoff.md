# Pilot MVP 01 — Handoff and open items

Status: Live document
Last updated: 2026-08-10

This is the single place to look for **things only the user can do**, and for
**decisions taken on the user's behalf** that they may want to reverse. Anything
that could be decided from the docs, the code or a spike was decided and
recorded in `docs/runbook.md`; only genuine external blockers land here.

Everything below is non-blocking for development on Linux. Work continues past
each item using the fallback stated.

---

## 1. Blocked on the user's Mac

None of this can be verified on the Linux development machine. The code is
written and merged; only the verification is outstanding.

Run from a clean checkout on macOS 13+ with Swift 5.9+:

```sh
nvm use && pnpm install

# 1. The Swift helper has never been compiled. This is the highest-value check.
swift build --package-path packages/platform-mac/native
swift test  --package-path packages/platform-mac/native

# 2. The helper transport demo against the real binary (not the Node stub).
pnpm build && pnpm --filter @pilot/platform-mac demo

# 3. A packaged bundle containing the REAL helper.
pnpm --filter @pilot/desktop run build:helper -- --require-native
pnpm package
pnpm --filter @pilot/desktop exec node scripts/verify-bundle.js   # expect `helper: native`

# 4. The desktop shell, visually. Linux only proves it launches headlessly.
pnpm dev
```

Notes:

- **A Swift compile failure is a PR-003 defect.** Send the compiler output and
  it gets fixed, not worked around. The author could not compile it and
  deliberately avoided constructs they were unsure of.
- Nothing in `native/` touches ScreenCaptureKit, Accessibility or entitlements
  yet, so this batch should raise **no TCC prompt**. That is deliberate: it
  isolates "does the helper build and talk" from "does macOS trust it", and the
  second question is PR-011's.
- `--require-native` in step 3 is the flag that matters. Without it the build
  silently stages a placeholder, and a bundle that cannot observe the screen is
  indistinguishable from one that can until someone tries it.

**Fallback in use:** Mac-gated code is written unverified and batched here
(runbook amendment 8, user decision). Accepted risk: PR-011 through PR-015
accumulate on top of an uncompiled helper.

---

## 2. Blocked on Codex sign-in

The user chose Codex subscription for model access (runbook amendment 7). Pi
0.84.1 supports it (`openai-codex`, `isSubscription: true`), verified by the
PR-005 spike. **No sign-in has happened**, and there is no API key in the Linux
environment, so no live provider call has ever been made.

Steps are in `docs/pi-notes.md` §9.1. Two findings to carry into it:

- **Use the device-code flow, not browser login.** Browser login binds local
  port 1455 and does *not* open a browser — it emits an `auth_url` the
  application must handle. The device-code flow is headless and is the right
  choice for a packaged app. PR-037 is written against this.
- Vision-capable models observed: `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.5`,
  `gpt-5.6-luna`. `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` is text-only and must fail the
  capability gate rather than silently ignoring images.

**Fallback in use:** everything runs against the mock provider. Phase 2 is
unaffected. Phase 3 integration (PR-029 onward) can be *built* but cannot be
*demonstrated against a real model* until sign-in happens.

**What the mock cannot prove**, and therefore what the first real session must
be watched for: provider-side image encoding, real streaming timing, and
compaction summary quality.

## 3. Accepted gaps against the MVP definition of done

Recorded so they are not discovered at release time.

| Gap | Why | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No notarization | No Developer ID account (user decision). A packaged app needs `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` or right-click → Open on any machine that did not build it, and TCC grants are re-prompted whenever the signature changes. | PR-042 |
| Development signing only | Same. `mac.identity` is null, hardened runtime off. | PR-042 |
| No CI | User decision. The five local commands in `docs/runbook.md` §6 are the only gate, run before every merge. | — |
| Grounding metric is a manual checklist | User decision — real apps rather than a purpose-built test app. ~30 cases, ≥90% required. | PR-043 |

---

## 4. Decisions taken without asking

Made under the standing instruction to use my own recommendation. Each is
reversible; raise any that look wrong.

| Decision | Reasoning |
| --- | --- |
| **PR-022 split into 022a/022b** | The PR-005 spike found compaction far larger than planned: Pi has no orchestrator, `AgentHarness.compact` is a stub, and the primitives operate on session `Entry[]` rather than the `AgentMessage[]` the agent holds. Pruning (022a) is nearly done; compaction (022b) is close to a full PR on its own. |
| **PR-007 sequenced after PR-002** | Both own root config and `apps/desktop`. Running them in parallel worktrees guaranteed a conflict in exactly the files PR-007 restructures. Cost: nothing on the critical path. |
| **PR-008 held until PR-007 landed** | Same collision, same reasoning — PR-007 rewrote the bundler under `apps/desktop` while PR-008 builds UI in it. |
| **`docs/system-design.md` corrected in place** | User-confirmed. Three claims were disproved by the spike; leaving them in a doc marked authoritative would mislead every future session. |
| **Agent worktrees excluded from lint/format** | `eslint .` was descending into other agents' half-written worktrees, making the verification gate nondeterministic — it failed and then passed with no code change. |
| **`dismiss-error` added to the desktop IPC validator** | The contract and the state machine had it; the renderer's validator did not, so the `error` state had no exit from the UI. Typecheck did not catch it because a narrower zod union stays assignable. |

## 5. Risks worth watching

- **TCC attribution for the spawned Swift helper** remains the top structural
  risk in the plan, and it is still entirely unverified. PR-011 is where it
  lands. If macOS attributes permissions to the helper rather than the parent
  bundle, the permission model in `docs/system-design.md` §4 needs rework.
- **`sharp` prebuilds inside packaged Electron (arm64)** — PR-018 owns image
  encoding; the packaging interaction has not been tested.
- **Double-JPEG legibility of small text** — capture encodes once, the
  processing pipeline encodes again. If grounding accuracy on small UI text
  disappoints in PR-043, this is the first thing to check.
- **Effort calibration** — `docs/implementation.md` PR size bands sum to
  roughly 2–3× the estimate in `dp/m1.md`. Treat any date derived from them
  with suspicion until several PRs have calibrated actual velocity.
